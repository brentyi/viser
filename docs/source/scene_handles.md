# Scene Handles

A handle is created for each object that is added to the scene. These can be
used to read and set state, as well as detect clicks.

When a scene node is added to a server (for example, via
:func:`viser.ViserServer.add_frame()`), state is synchronized between all
connected clients. When a scene node is added to a client (for example, via
:func:`viser.ClientHandle.add_frame()`), state is local to a specific client.
